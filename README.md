# Sudoku
This is a game of Sudoku that I wrote in Java that anyone can utilize for free!
I made this game in May of 2023 as a high school Freshmen.
This was my first game/larger project that I wrote completely without using any starter code or external assistance!
I managed to learn from that how to design and plan out a project, carry out the steps, problem solve, and persevere in order to see my program succeed!!!
You can change the number of given numbers for the Sudoku in the field "givens" of the class Soduko to make the game easier or harder!!
I hope you enjoy and I'm honored to present you with my project!
